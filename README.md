  ## Description

  This project had me using node to generate a read me that follows the guidelines for a properly written file from the link added below. I started out by making variables for the packages that would be needed. I had forgotten this weeks homework included some starting code, so I made a few changes with the guidance of the develop folder provided. I made two different JS files one that would contain the function to display the questions and generate the file  when called and another to hold the questions that would be asked. I used the following website to understand how to utilize an async function with util. At some point my async function was not working until I noticed I had added an extra character and was easily fixed.
